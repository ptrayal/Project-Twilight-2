Hello everyone:
  Took some serious steps today towards stablizing the code.  Found a
serious bug which I'm in the process of tracking down and smashing.

Some other things got fixed this week, though it was a slow week.  Most
of what I've done has been backend stuff to prop up the code and make it
more reliable and cleaner.

The things which would be noticable is Character Creation is slowly
getting reworked, hunting will be done soon (probably), and the polling
system is gone.  Next week, assuming I can squash this bug and have
time, I'll finish one of them and then start moving on. I'm in the
process of squashing bugs and slowly doing new features.

  OK, I can definitely do advanced powers and combo disciplines.  I
haven't created any yet, but I now have the capacity to.  Once I am sure
the existing disciplines are working the way they should and bug free
(see the updates page for the bugs I keep finding), I'll move on to
creating new disciplines.  Of course, I'll then need to create the cost
for them, but that will come.

Subject State of the Mud~
Success 1~
Text
Hello

As I posted on the web site, there is a serious rewrite of code taking
place.  This rewrite is necessary, as the code is otherwise very
unstable.  This port is being left up to play on and use, but I have
another port where the major changes are being tested and implemented.
When I push the new code over here, it will bring stability to the mud
like we have never had before, in addition to squashing an untold number
of bugs.

It will, however, take in all likely-hood, till the middle of February
to get to that point.  We are talking about rewriting a large amount of
code and getting things stable.
 
If anyone has any questions, please let me know.

Hello again:
  It's been a week or so since I made an update.  The development port
to address memory issues is coming along much better than I would have
hoped.  It has revealed a number of other issues along the way, which
have been being dealt with.  It's been pretty intense, but has made the
MUD much stabler (even though it is not up yet).  I actually hope to be
able to port over the new stable version of the code next week to here
and have a new stable mud to play on.  There are still plenty of other
things to work on concerning stability after that, but then we will have
the most up to date code running over here for people to try and break.

{WThat's this update, if you have any questions, please ask.{x

Hey Adam:
  It's still being worked on.  There was some downtime last week because
of a server issue.  Then, I've been sick the past few days, so just
haven't been on.  I'm still working on stability issues but am very
close to releasing the more stable code.

That being said, then I'll be able to begin really working on things
that need to be worked on.  In the course of this work on stability
issues, I've discovered a number of bugs all over the code that I am
busy working on as well, in addition to trying to rework the combat
code.  Unfortunately, I'm not able to do a whole lot till I get the
code's memory issues fixed because I don't want to introduce new
features (and thus maybe new bugs) till the existing issues are
resolved.
 
So, that's where things are right now.

Hey, just another update before I head home.

Made some awesome progress today concerning stability.  I actually
really hope to have the new stable code pushed to production by the end
of the week.  I found a number of bugs concerning the memory today and
squashed them with a big shoe.    It's revealed how buggy parts of the
code are and how they are going to be rewritten.

First though, there getting the code stable, then comes a whole bunch of
bug fixes. Then, after that, I think you'll see some pretty cool
features coming (yes, your advanced disciplines among them).

Hello:
  Most of the mall, from the Food court west, as gotten a remodelling

and got rid of the people selling bad food and brought in some new
people to sell food.
 
  Mall ownership says the rest of the Mall will be remodelled soon.

Hello agin,
  Well, we have begun moving from C to C++.  This is because of the huge
memory errors we are experiencing and will allow us to handle things in
much more efficient manner.  It does mean, pushing it to production is
delayed, but that cannot be helped.
 
More to come as it continues to be worked on.

Success 1~

Hello everyone:
  This update I bring you very good news.  The dev code is almost ready
for release.  It will be a much stabler, friendly code, though still
with it's bugs.

To give you an idea of how much work has been done.  The version
currently running is 1.1.1.32, the development version is 1.1.1.526.
Which means, I really need to make it 1.1.5.26. It is astounding how
much work has been done to make PT more stable.  Now, when we release
it, I am sure there will be many more bugs you will be able to find for
me, and that is what I am hoping for. As you find them, I'll be able to
fix them quickly and without bringing the place crashing down.

Hello everyone:
  There was more area cleanup done.  Basically, I removed areas which
are not ever going to be finished in all likelyhood.  I also did some
backend work on renaming areas to some sort of standard and then
cleaning up the directory.  Prep work for greater things.
